## Documentation

See the [wolfSSL Manual](https://www.wolfssl.com/documentation/manuals/wolfssl/index.html).

The [wolfSSL embedded TLS library](https://www.wolfssl.com/products/wolfssl/) is a lightweight, portable,
C-language-based SSL/TLS library targeted at IoT, embedded, and RTOS environments primarily because of its size,
speed, and feature set. It works seamlessly in desktop, enterprise, and cloud environments as well.
wolfSSL supports industry standards up to the current [TLS 1.3](https://www.wolfssl.com/tls13) and DTLS 1.3,
is up to 20 times smaller than OpenSSL, offers a simple API, an OpenSSL compatibility layer,
OCSP and CRL support, is backed by the robust [wolfCrypt cryptography library](https://github.com/wolfssl/wolfssl/tree/master/wolfcrypt),
and much more.

## FIPS 140-3

"Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS) 140-3 became effective September 22, 2019,
permitting CMVP to begin accepting validation submissions under the new scheme beginning September 2020.
The FIPS 140-3 standard introduces some significant changes in the management over the previous standard.
Rather than encompassing the module requirements directly, FIPS 140-3 references  International
Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 19790. The testing
for these requirements will be in accordance with ISO/IEC 24759."

See: https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/fips-140-3-standards

### What is FIPS 140-3?

Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-3 is a mandatory standard for the protection of sensitive or valuable data within Federal systems.

FIPS 140-3 is an incremental advancement of FIPS 140-2, which standardized on the ISO 19790:2012 and ISO 24759:2017 specifications. Historically, ISO 19790 was based on FIPS 140-2, but has continued to advance since that time. FIPS 140-3 will now point back to ISO 19790 for security requirements. Keeping FIPS 140-3 as a separate standard will still allow NIST to mandate additional requirements on top of what the ISO standard contains when needed.

Among the changes for FIPS 140-3 are conditional algorithm self-tests, where the algorithm self-tests are only performed if used. The pre-operational self-test is now faster, as all the algorithms are not tested until needed. This helps with startup times as the public key self-testing can be time consuming. The self tests can be run at appropriate times for your application startup. Also, there is additional testing of the DRBG entropy sources.

### Why is FIPS 140 Important?

Federal agencies purchasing cryptographic-based security systems must confirm an associated FIPS 140-3 certificate exists.

This procurement check-box item is a deal breaker. Vendor claims of designed for FIPS or FIPS ready do not pass this hurdle. Also, be careful with claims of vendor affirmation, as it is frequently a red flag for federal buyers.

No FIPS certificate = No sale

Federal buyers and auditors will also confirm FIPS validation by confirming a match between your certificate's operational environment listings and your product.

## wolfCrypt FIPS 140-3 available now

wolfCrypt FIPS 140-3 has a five year certificate [#4718](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/4718),
valid through 7/10/2029. wolfCrypt FIPS supports Conditional Power on Self Test (CAST) for every algorithm
in the boundary and is the only embedded FIPS 140-3 solution available.

cd wolfssl_benchmark
idf.py -b 115200 flash monitor
```


### Espressif Component Notes

Here are some ESP Registry-specific details of the wolfssl component.

#### Component Name

The naming convention of the build-system name of a dependency installed by the component manager
is always `namespace__component`. The namespace for wolfSSL is `wolfssl`. The build-system name
is thus `wolfssl__wolfssl`. We've also published `wolfssh`, `wolfmqtt` and more coming soon.

https://components.espressif.com/components?q=namespace:wolfssl

A project `cmakelists.txt` doesn't need to mention it at all when using wolfSSL as a managed component.


#### Component Manager

To check which version of the [Component Manager](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/idf-component-manager/en/latest/getting_started/index.html#checking-the-idf-component-manager-version)
is currently available, use the command:

```bash
python -m idf_component_manager -h
```

The Component Manager should have been installed during the [installation of the ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/#installation).
If your version of ESP-IDF doesn't come with the IDF Component Manager,
you can [install it](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/idf-component-manager/en/latest/guides/updating_component_manager.html#installing-and-updating-the-idf-component-manager):

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade idf-component-manager
```

For further details on the Espressif Component Manager, see the [idf-component-manager repo](https://github.com/espressif/idf-component-manager/).

## Staging Preview Versions

There are experimental, generally unsupported preview versions of components available at https://components-staging.espressif.com/

The staging versions are developer-specific and components are renamed with a "my" prefix. (e.g. "mywolfssl")

There are some [gojimmypi] versions available here in the "gojimmypi" namespace:

https://components-staging.espressif.com/components?q=namespace:gojimmypi

When using staging components, be sure to define the `IDF_COMPONENT_REGISTRY_URL` environment variable:

```bash
export IDF_COMPONENT_REGISTRY_URL="https://components-staging.espressif.com"
```

# Release README
# wolfSSL Embedded SSL/TLS Library

The [wolfSSL embedded SSL library](https://www.wolfssl.com/products/wolfssl/)
(formerly CyaSSL) is a lightweight SSL/TLS library written in ANSI C and
targeted for embedded, RTOS, and resource-constrained environments - primarily
because of its small size, speed, and feature set.  It is commonly used in
standard operating environments as well because of its royalty-free pricing
and excellent cross platform support. wolfSSL supports industry standards up
to the current [TLS 1.3](https://www.wolfssl.com/tls13) and DTLS 1.3, is up to
20 times smaller than OpenSSL, and offers progressive ciphers such as ChaCha20,
Curve25519, Blake2b and Post-Quantum TLS 1.3 groups. User benchmarking and
feedback reports dramatically better performance when using wolfSSL over
OpenSSL.

wolfSSL is powered by the wolfCrypt cryptography library. Two versions of
wolfCrypt have been FIPS 140-2 validated (Certificate #2425 and
certificate #3389). FIPS 140-3 validated (Certificate #4718). For additional
information, visit the [wolfCrypt FIPS FAQ](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/fips/)
or contact fips@wolfssl.com.

## Why Choose wolfSSL?

There are many reasons to choose wolfSSL as your embedded, desktop, mobile, or
enterprise SSL/TLS solution. Some of the top reasons include size (typical
footprint sizes range from 20-100 kB), support for the newest standards
(SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3, DTLS 1.0, DTLS 1.2, and DTLS 1.3),
current and progressive cipher support (including stream ciphers), multi-platform,
royalty free, and an OpenSSL compatibility API to ease porting into existing
applications which have previously used the OpenSSL package. For a complete
feature list, see [Chapter 4](https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/wolfssl-manual/ch4/)
of the wolfSSL manual.

## Notes, Please Read

### Note 1
wolfSSL as of 3.6.6 no longer enables SSLv3 by default.  wolfSSL also no longer
supports static key cipher suites with PSK, RSA, or ECDH. This means if you
plan to use TLS cipher suites you must enable DH (DH is on by default), or
enable ECC (ECC is on by default), or you must enable static key cipher suites
with one or more of the following defines:

```
WOLFSSL_STATIC_DH
WOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA
WOLFSSL_STATIC_PSK
```
Though static key cipher suites are deprecated and will be removed from future
versions of TLS.  They also lower your security by removing PFS.

When compiling `ssl.c`, wolfSSL will now issue a compiler error if no cipher
suites are available. You can remove this error by defining
`WOLFSSL_ALLOW_NO_SUITES` in the event that you desire that, i.e., you're
not using TLS cipher suites.

### Note 2
wolfSSL takes a different approach to certificate verification than OpenSSL
does. The default policy for the client is to verify the server, this means
that if you don't load CAs to verify the server you'll get a connect error,
no signer error to confirm failure (-188).

If you want to mimic OpenSSL behavior of having `SSL_connect` succeed even if
verifying the server fails and reducing security you can do this by calling:

```c
wolfSSL_CTX_set_verify(ctx, WOLFSSL_VERIFY_NONE, NULL);
```

before calling `wolfSSL_new();`. Though it's not recommended.

### Note 3
The enum values SHA, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512 are no longer available when
wolfSSL is built with `--enable-opensslextra` (`OPENSSL_EXTRA`) or with the
macro `NO_OLD_SHA_NAMES`. These names get mapped to the OpenSSL API for a
single call hash function. Instead the name `WC_SHA`, `WC_SHA256`, `WC_SHA384` and
`WC_SHA512` should be used for the enum name.

PR stands for Pull Request, and PR <NUMBER> references a GitHub pull request number where the code change was added.

## Vulnerabilities

* [Low] There is the potential for a fault injection attack on ECC and Ed25519 verify operations. In versions of wolfSSL 5.7.6 and later the --enable-faultharden option is available to help mitigate against potential fault injection attacks. The mitigation added in wolfSSL version 5.7.6 is to help harden applications relying on the results of the verify operations, such as when used with wolfBoot. If doing ECC or Ed25519 verify operations on a device at risk for fault injection attacks then --enable-faultharden could be used to help mitigate it. Thanks to Kevin from Fraunhofer AISEC for the report.

Hardening option added in PR https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/8289


* [High CVE-2025-7395] When using WOLFSSL_SYS_CA_CERTS and WOLFSSL_APPLE_NATIVE_CERT_VALIDATION on an Apple platform, the native trust store verification routine overrides errors produced elsewhere in the wolfSSL certificate verification process including failures due to hostname matching/SNI, OCSP, CRL, etc. This allows any trusted cert chain to override other errors detected during chain verification that should have resulted in termination of the TLS connection. If building wolfSSL on versions after 5.7.6 and before 5.8.2 with use of the system CA support and the apple native cert validation feature enabled on Apple devices (on by default for non-macOS Apple targets when using autotools or CMake) we recommend updating to the latest version of wolfSSL. Thanks to Thomas Leong from ExpressVPN for the report.

Fixed in PR https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/8833


* [Med. CVE-2025-7394] In the OpenSSL compatibility layer implementation, the function RAND_poll() was not behaving as expected and leading to the potential for predictable values returned from RAND_bytes() after fork() is called. This can lead to weak or predictable random numbers generated in applications that are both using RAND_bytes() and doing fork() operations. This only affects applications explicitly calling RAND_bytes() after fork() and does not affect any internal TLS operations. Although RAND_bytes() documentation in OpenSSL calls out not being safe for use with fork() without first calling RAND_poll(), an additional code change was also made in wolfSSL to make RAND_bytes() behave similar to OpenSSL after a fork() call without calling RAND_poll(). Now the Hash-DRBG used gets reseeded after detecting running in a new process. If making use of RAND_bytes() and calling fork() we recommend updating to the latest version of wolfSSL. Thanks to Per Allansson from Appgate for the report.

https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/8898



* [Low CVE-2025-7396] In wolfSSL 5.8.0 the option of hardening the C implementation of Curve25519 private key operations was added with the addition of blinding support (https://www.wolfssl.com/curve25519-blinding-support-added-in-wolfssl-5-8-0/). In wolfSSL release 5.8.2 that blinding support is turned on by default in applicable builds. The blinding configure option is only for the base C implementation of Curve25519. It is not needed, or available with; ARM assembly builds, Intel assembly builds, and the small Curve25519 feature. While the attack would be very difficult to execute in practice, enabling blinding provides an additional layer of protection for devices that may be more susceptible to physical access or side-channel observation. Thanks to Arnaud Varillon, Laurent Sauvage, and Allan Delautre from Telecom Paris for the report.

Blinding enabled by default in PR https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/8736
